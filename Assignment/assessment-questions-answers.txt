FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS IN NODE.JS
Assessment Answers

1. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations

Synchronous file operations block the execution of the program. The next line of code runs only after the file operation is completed. These methods are easy to understand but can slow down applications.

Asynchronous file operations do not block the execution. The program continues running while the file operation is handled in the background, which improves performance.

Example:
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);


2. When should file streams be used instead of reading the entire file?

File streams should be used when working with large files to avoid high memory usage. Streams read data in small chunks and are useful for processing data while it is being read.

Example:
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = fs.createReadStream('large.txt', 'utf8');


3. Purpose of the 'utf8' encoding parameter

The 'utf8' encoding converts file data into readable text. Without encoding, Node.js returns file data as binary (Buffer). UTF-8 supports most characters and is commonly used for text files.


4. Common file system error codes

ENOENT: File or directory does not exist  
EACCES: Permission denied  
EEXIST: File already exists  
EISDIR: Expected a file but found a directory  
ENOTDIR: Expected a directory but found a file  


5. How to safely delete a directory with all its contents

The fs.rm() method with recursive option is used to delete a directory along with all its files.

Example:
const fs = require('fs').promises;
await fs.rm('folder', { recursive: true, force: true });


6. Concept of piping in streams

Piping allows data to flow from one stream to another automatically without loading the entire data into memory.

Example:
fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));


7. Importance of handling errors in file operations

Error handling prevents application crashes and helps manage issues like missing files or permission errors.

Example:
try {
  fs.readFileSync('file.txt');
} catch {
  console.log('Error occurred');
}


8. Difference between writeFile and appendFile

writeFile replaces the file content, while appendFile adds new data to the end of the file.

Example:
await fs.writeFile('test.txt', 'Hello');
await fs.appendFile('test.txt', ' World');
